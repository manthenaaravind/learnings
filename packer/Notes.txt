Packer:
•	It is a tool which is used to automate the custom image creation for VM.
•	It is developed by Hashicorp
  -> create a json file with the image information and the softwares required.
  -> execute packer to create image in any virtualization platform.
•	Documentation: https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs
•	It is an immutable tool, which means you cannot update the resources which are already created. you need to delete the old and create again.
 
Install:
1.	we can install directly from google or
2.	choco install packer -y
 
Packer Json:
•	it has the following sections
Variables: where you can create variables to use along with default values
Builder: where to create image i.e virtualization platform (AWS/Azure)
Provisioner: commands to be executed to install software (shell/powershell/ansible/chef/puppet)
Post-Processor: any post build activities
 
 
Variables:
•	we can define required field values as variables and we can change during build time.
•	variables defined in the packer template are called "user variables".
•	you can access the user variables inside the template using syntax  "{{user `myvar`}}"
•	pass variables from command line using   -var "name=value"
•	to pass variables values from a file in command line, use  -var-file <json file> option.
•	we can also use environmental variables defined in that system. for that the syntax will be                                "{{env `PATH`}}"
 
Builders:
•	Builder is a virtualization env where packer can build an image 
 
Provisioners:
•	used for installing softwares / packages e.t.c 
•	we can use shell/ansible/chef
 
Post-Processors:
•	post processors are used after the image is built.they can be used to upload artifacts, re-package or more e.t.c.
 
Communicators:
•	communicators will define how we can connect to the created VM to execute our scripts
•	By deafult "ssh" will be used for lnux images but for windows images we need to set"winrm" as value of communicator in builder section.
 
packer functions:
•	in packer there are some default functions available which we can use while building the images. 
•	ex:  adding timestamp to the image name, cleanup resources names (removing spaces)
•	Useful functions:
a) isotime
b) clean_resource_name
 
 
To create Image using Packer:
 
a.	Info needed for AWS:
•	AWS account:
    Create secret key and access key for packer (IAM user)
•	Source image AMI
•	provisioning script
•	Region
 
Commands:
packer validate <json file>
packer build -Debug <json file>
